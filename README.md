This is a demo of my portfolio website made with PHP and SQL. 
Includes form validation, filter input, output, sticky form properties and language changing properties.
All of the code is open for share so you can use it.
If you are having trouble figuring out some code feel free to contact me: jessielee.shl@gmail.com
